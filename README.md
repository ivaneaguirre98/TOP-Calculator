## Challenges I Faced
Some challenges that we faced was building out the functionality that allows users to enter in multiple functions without hitting the equal button. Ex. (12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42). 

Another challege was the styling of the buttons so that it will look like a tradtional calculator.
